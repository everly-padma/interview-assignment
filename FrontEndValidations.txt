FrontEnd UI Validations:


Pre-requisite:  For all the scenarios mentioned below I will use selenium as that is a skillset I have, In Selenium we load the chromeless browser to test the application.And each field is accessed by their xpath(uniqueid/unique layout)

I am only writing the snippet here for the tests without the xpath

1. Cover the most critical and risk-prone functionality related to this feature.

Scenario 1: (important scenario - ; segregation of Duty (SOD); only admin user should have access to manage discounts)

Open the login page
Use admin user/password to login
  Validate 
	- “Manage Discount” endpoint is managed by role based access control; Feature is available only to admin user(s) 
	- “Manage Discounts” link option not available to not admin users
 

Scenario 2:  invalid promo code
Open the login page
Use regular user/password to login
Add items to the cart
Go to checkout
Enter the invalid promo code
  Validate 
	- The promo code is rejected by the application

2. Perform validations to ensure the expected items, quantity and discount are reflected in the shopping cart.

Scenario 1:

Open the login page
Use enduser/password to login
  Search Items 
  Select quantity 6
  Add to cart
Validate:
	- there are quantity = 6 in the cart
	- discount applied for having at least 5 items 
	- discount applied = price of one item 
	- total price = price of 5 items 
	
Scenario 2:

Open the login page
Use enduser/password to login
  Search Items 
  Select quantity 4
  Add to cart
Validate:
	- there are quantity = 4 in the cart
	- discount NOT applied for NOT having at least 5 items 
	- total price = price of 4 items 
 
Scenario 3:

Open the login page
Use enduser/password to login
  Search Items 
  Select quantity 5
  Add to cart
Validate:
	- there are quantity = 5 in the cart
	- discount applied for having at least 5 items 
	- discount applied = price of one item 
	- total price = price of 4 items 

Scenario 4:

Open the login page
Use enduser/password to login
  Search Items 
  Select quantity 6
  Add to cart
  Go to checkout
  Enter the valid promo code
Validate:
	- there are quantity = 5 in the cart
	- if promo code discount > volume discount then promo code discount is applied. Else volume discount is applied 
	- discount applied = based on the above rule
	- total price = total price of 5 items - discount amount
		

3. Submit payment and complete the purchase.
