FrontEnd UI Validations:


Pre-requisite:  For all the scenarios mentioned below I will use selenium as that is a skillset I have, In Selenium we load the chromeless browser to test the application.And each field is accessed by their xpath(uniqueid/unique layout)

I am only writing the snippet here for the tests without the xpath


Scenario 1: (important scenario - ; segregation of Duty (SOD); only admin user should have access to manage discounts)

Open the login page
Use admin user/password to login
  Validate 
	- “Manage Discount” endpoint is managed by role based access control; Feature is available only to admin user(s) 
	- “Manage Discounts” link option not available to not admin users
 
Scenario 2:

Open the login page
Use admin user/password to login
  Open “New Discount” 
  Validate specifications and date formats for 
	- “Name” for discount
	- “Active From Date”
	- “Active Till Date”
	- choose “Volume discount” as discount type is available
	- provide the number input for the MINIMUM count for volume discount 
	- the % discount amount based on the base amount of each item Or, some fixed amount
	- “Save” is ENABLED
